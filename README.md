### PWA quick-start

PWA template with OnsenUI and Creat-React-App.
Please note that you'll still have to `npm install` and:

1. Choose an app name and description and update `package.json`, `public/index.html`, `public/manifest.json`
2. Update create-react-app stuff [as described here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/updating-to-new-releases/)
3. Update the dependencies `npx ncu -u` (WARNING: This might result in incompatibilities! Do this at your own risk of fixing stuff afterwards!)
4. Add a logo (replace the `public/logo.svg`) and run the PWA asset generator `npm run build-assets`

Run the app with `npm start`.
