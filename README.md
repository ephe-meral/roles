Roles is an experiment in using role-play to facilitate self-reflection.

Create [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com)-like dialogs from your mobile device.

I use it to try and get a distanced view on ideas, problems etc. that I try to solve, by role-playing 3rd party observers or experts that evaluate them.

It works better than just thinking about something, since you have a record of what has been written by each party and you have enough time during each interaction to emphasize with the role you're taking/playing.

Think of it as a cheap way to get coaching from someone who knows you better than most people.

Or think of it as a way to facilitate conversations among your split personalities. Fun!

#### data

Everything is stored in your browser (in `window.localStorage`), i.e. none of your conversations are ever shared with anyone.
If you want to back-up your conversations, there is an export/import menu in the (main) sessions screen.

Hint: As this is a progressive web app, you can install it to your home screen and use it like any other app. Android will automatically suggest that and in iOS you need to check your Safari export menu when you're on the page.


#### run

```
> git clone ... && cd ...
> npm install
> npm start
```

#### is it any good?

Bien sÃ»r.
